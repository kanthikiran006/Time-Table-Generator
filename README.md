# Time-Table-Generator
The Time Table Generator is a software application designed to automate the process of creating timetables for educational institutions, such as schools, colleges, and universities. It simplifies the task of scheduling classes, allocating teachers and rooms, and managing the overall timetable creation process.

This code sets up a basic GUI using Tkinter with two sections: Course and Subject Management and Timetable Generation. The Course and Subject Management section allows the user to enter a course name and subject, and upon clicking the "Add Subject" button, a message box is displayed confirming the addition of the subject.

The Timetable Generation section consists of a "Generate Timetable" button. When clicked, a message box is displayed indicating the successful generation of the timetable. You can implement the timetable generation algorithm and the actual display of the timetable based on your specific requirements.

Feel free to modify the code as per your project needs, add additional functionalities, and integrate the actual logic for subject/course management, timetable generation, and generate it.
